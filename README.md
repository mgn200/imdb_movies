# ImdbPlayfield

ImdbPlayfield is a Ruby study project, built with the mentoring help of mkdev.me team member.
It covers everything a good junior-level developer should know about Ruby. It uses imdb top 250 movies as a playground
for Ruby features and design patterns.

It implements:
 - Parsing text files, creating objects from data
 - Sorting and filtering collections, data manipulation(movies)
 - Playing around with classes relationships: movies, theaters, helper modules, service objects
 - Test Driven Development
 - DSL
 - Basic objects designing, composition and inheritance
 - Scrapping with Nokogiri
 - Working with tmdb.com API
 - Using HAML and bootstrap template to create html page of top 250 movies
 - Learning correct documentation and project structure, wrapping code in gem

## Install

Install gem and don't forget to require it
```ruby
gem install imdb_playfield
```
```ruby
require 'imdb_playfield'
```

You can also use some commands from CLI, сalling imdb and tmdp data fetchers and folder/files builders.

## Usage

Main entities and their functionality.

### <a name="Netflix"></a> Netflix

Netflix is a representation of online movie theater.

```ruby
netflix = ImdbPlayfield::Netflix.new

# Balance is 0 dollars by default
# You can put money and use it to pay for movies
netflix.pay 10
netflix.balance       # 10

# You can order movies, if you have enough money, by providing desired movie parameters
netflix.show(year: 2000, genre: 'Drama')

# You can also use more advanced filtering and save your filters for future use
netflix.show { |movie| !movie.title.include?('Terminator') && movie.genre.include?('Action') && movie.year > 2003 }
netflix.define_filter(:new_sci_fi) { movie.period: :new, movie.genre: 'Sci-Fi' }
netflix.show(new_sci_fi: true)

# Returns the price for the given movie title
# netflix.show will raise 'Insufficient funds' ArgumentError, if you don't have enough money on balance
netflix.how_much? 'The Terminator'        # 10

# Start builds an html page
# Make sure you run bin/fetch_imdb and bin/fetch_tmdb before build_html
# as the method uses additional data from YML files generated by these external requests
# (they are covered in IMDBScrapper and TMDBApi classes)

# Some DSL for more convenient filters
netflix.by_genre.comedy # returns all the comedies
netflix.by_country.usa # returns all movies made in USA
```

You can also call #pay and #show in you terminal instead of code:
imdb_playfield netflix pay 25
imdb_playfield netflix show genre:Comedy year:2002

**Netflix#build_html** method will create an index.html file with movies from movie collection and their info
It uses HamlBuilder class, that handles all the work.

Bear in mind, by default ImdbPlayfield gem packed two data files with additional information about movies:
"imdb_movie_info.yml" and "tmdb_movie_info". Both of these files are created using TMDBApi.run and IMDBScrapper.run
Additional data in these files are used in rendering index.html page. Files are packed inside the gem, but will be overwritten
with fresh info if TMDBApi.run or IMDBScrapper.run called by user. In order for that to work, you need to build required files and folders.

Please check more at [link](#TMDBApi) [link](#IMDBScrapper)

```ruby
netflix.build_html                                   # Build index.html and puts it in data/views files with movies representation
```

### Theatre

Theatre is a representation of real world theater.

```ruby
theater = ImdbPlayfield::Theatre.new

# Use DSL to build your own schedule, it uses default one otherwise.
# If your schedule periods intersect with each other or have holes between first and last of them, an error will be raised

theatre = ImdbPlayfield::Theater.new do                              
    hall :red, title: 'Красный зал', places: 100
    hall :blue, title: 'Синий зал', places: 50
    hall :green, title: 'Зелёный зал (deluxe)', places: 12

    period '09:00'..'11:00' do
      description 'Morning session'
      filters genre: 'Comedy', year: 1900..1980
      price 10
      hall :red, :blue
    end

    period '11:00'..'16:00' do
      description 'Special'
      title 'The Terminator'
      price 50
      hall :green
    end

    period '16:00'..'20:00' do
      description 'Evening session'
      filters genre: ['Action', 'Drama'], year: 2007..Time.now.year
      price 20
      hall :red, :blue
    end

    period '19:00'..'22:00' do
      description 'Evening session for movie fans'
      filters year: 1900..1945, exclude_country: 'USA'
      price 30
      hall :green
    end
  end

# Prints schedule for user
theatre.info

# Buy ticket for the given movie. Hall must be specified if movie is showed in two or more halls.
theatre.buy_ticket('The Terminator', :red)

# Shows number of cash in theatre.
theatre.cash

# Returns periods of time when the given movie is show
theatre.when? 'The Terminator'

# Show all halls in theatre
theatre.halls
```

#### MovieCollection

MovieCollection is a base class that parses movie.txt(or similar user-provided file) and creates
movie library. It also provides sorting and filtering methods.

```ruby
# Creates movie collection from file specified as argument. By default uses movies.txt packed in gem.
# Default movies. txt is top 250 movies from imdb.
movies_collection = ImdbPlayfield::MovieCollection.new()

# Basic examplee
imdb_movies.filter(country: 'USA')                   # returns array of movies made in USA
imdb_movies.filter(rating: 8.2)                      # returns array of movies with rating of 8.2
imdb_movies.sample(10).has_genre?('Comedy')          # returns true of false if any comedy movie present in array

# Array of every parsed movie from movies.txt or user file.
movies_collection.all                              # [ModernMOvie, AncientMovie, ClassicMovie, ... ]

# Sort movies array by given attribute name.
movies_collection.sort_by(:director)

# Filters movie collection based on parameters(movie attributes) provided in hash.
# You can also use exclude_#{attribute} parameter.
movies_collection.filter(period: :new, exclude_country: 'USA', genre: 'Action')

# Random weighted movie pick from array.
# Higher rated movies will be a bit more likely to be selected
movies_collection.pick_movie movies_collection.sample(10)

# Counts every attribute values and returns a statistic in hash. For example:
movies_collection.stats(:genre)                 # { 'Comedy' => 28, 'Action' => 15, 'Drama' => 89, ... }
# or
movies_collection.stats(:director)
```

#### Movie

Movie is an abstract class for every movie parsed and created from movies.txt
It inherits to 4 movie classes, based on film year: AncientMovie, ModernMovie, NewMovie, ClassicMovie.
Every movie is created when MovieCollection is initialized.

```ruby
movie = ImdbPlayfield::MovieCollection.new.all.first

movie.to_s        # Returns a string with basic movie info
movie.month       # "January"
movie.price       # 10 (in dollars)
```

#### HamlBuilder

This class builds index.html page and saves it in your_current_folder/data/views.
It is mainly used in Netflix#build_html method, but can be accessed straightforward.

```ruby
ImdbPlayfield::HamlBuilder.new.build_html
```

### <a name="TMDBApi"></a> TMDBApi

Class that handles querying to tmdb.com api and saving data to local yml file.
It fetches additional movie data provided by tmdb.com, that is used by HamlBuilder when building html.
By default, ImdbPlayfield gem is already packed with tmdb_movie_info.yml, that provide additional movie info.
But user can manually make request to update information and create local tmdb_movie_info.yml file.
HamlBuilder will use that file instead.

**NOTE**
Before calling TMDBApi and updating movie info, you need to prepare folders, clean tmdb_movie_info.yml file
and config.yml file which will store you tmdb.com API key. If you don't have it. You need to register at tmdb.com and get the key.

You can do all this in terminal, or in your code:
**CLI**
imdb_playfield create_config      => creates config.yml in current directory, dont't forget to insert API key in it.
imdb_playfield scaffold_new       => created data/views and all empty fiels that are needed for data miners
                                             (TMDBApi and IMDBScrapper)

Ruby code, doest same as above
```ruby
ImdbPlayfield.create_config
ImdbPlayfield.create_data_files
```

After that you can call TMDBApi runner, that will save information to your_current_folder/data/tmdb_movie_info.yml
**CLi**
imdb_playfield fetch_tmdb       => data/tmdb_movie_info.yml

Ruby
```ruby
ImdbPlayfield::TMDBAPi.run      #  data/tmdb_movie_info.yml
```
### <a name="IMDBScrapper"></a> IDMBScrapper

Imdb.com web scrapper. It opens movie page for every movie in a given array of movies
based on their imdb id, and fetches additional information about movie budget.
Default array of movies is MovieCollection.all

It functions just as ImdbPlayfield::TMDBApi. It uses imdb_movie_info.yml file as default one
and copies TMDBApi behavior in termns of manual user update - will overwrite yml file, but needs
folders and file created preemptively(not config.yml though)

Check [link][#TMDBApi] last section for CLI and Ruby builder.

To run scrapper:
**CLI**
imdb_playfield fetch_imdb                => data/imdb_movie_info.yml

Ruby
```ruby                                  
ImdbPlayfield::IMDBScrapper.run           # data/imdb_movie_info.yml
```
